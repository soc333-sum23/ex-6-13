# Exercise: Hypothesis testing

## Setup: run these two chunks first!

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# the infer package is new, so we need to install it.
# this one only needs to be run one time
install.packages("infer")
```

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
library(openintro)
# we're adding the infer package to our lineup today
library(infer)
```

## Q1: Determining the correct hypothesis test, part 1

For each of these research questions, identify the explanatory variable, the response variable, their types, and the correct statistical test. *Think about what the data would look like for each individual in these cases*

a.  How does the amount of money a country spends on healthcare (per person) affect its average life expectancy?

    -   Explanatory variable(s) and type(s)?
    -   Response variable and type?
    -   Correct statistical test?

## Q2: Determining the correct hypothesis test, part 2

Same thing, new questions. For each, identify the explanatory variable, the response variable, their types, and the correct statistical test.

b.  How is a patient's body mass index related to the probability a doctor refers them to a specialist?

    -   Explanatory variable(s) and type(s)?
    -   Response variable and type?
    -   Correct statistical test?

c.  How do outcomes of traffic stops (which can be warnings, citations, or arrests) vary by the driver's race?

    -   Explanatory variable(s) and type(s)?
    -   Response variable and type?
    -   Correct statistical test?

## Q3: Running your first hypothesis test!

We will be returning to the `acs12` data for this exercise. We will be using two variables: `gender` and `married`.

Both are categorical variables with two categories (male/female for gender, yes/no for married), so we'll use a two-sample Z test, just like in the class example.

Research question: How is someone's gender identity related to their probability of being married?

Here's a table to show the relationship between the two variables.

```{r}
table(acs12$gender, acs12$married)
```

### Step 1: Calculate the test statistic

Then look at it in the data viewer. What is the Z score of this sample?

(You might notice that R gives you a warning message. This is fine in this case! It just means we shouldn't read into the positive/negative sign on the Z score. But since we're doing a two-tailed test here, that didn't matter anyway.)

```{r}
test_stat <- XXXX |> 
  specify(explanatory = XXXX,
          response = XXXX,
          success = "yes") |> 
  hypothesize(null = "independence") |> 
  calculate(stat = "z")
```

### Step 2: Simulate the null distribution

```{r}
# 1. copy your code from above
# 2. change the name of the object from test_stat to null_dist
# 3. add generate(reps = 1000) in the correct place, like in the class example
```

### Step 3: Calculate the p value of your sample

Then interpret it. At a threshold value of p = 0.05, do you reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis that about the same number of men are married as women?

```{r}
get_p_value(XXXX)
```

### Step 4: Visualize where your sample is with respect to your null distribution

```{r}
visualize(null_dist) +
  XXXX
```

# Extra Credit

## Q4: Run a hypothesis test to answer the research question below: 

How is language spoken related to citizenship status among people who live in the US? 

Use the `acs12` data. 

## a: What are your null and alternative hypotheses? 

## b: What are the explanatory and response variables, and what types are they? What kind of test do you need to run?

```{r}
# use this chunk to help you get a look at your data!
```

## c: Run your test!

```{r}
# first: calculate your test statistic
test_stat <- acs12 |> 
  specify(XXXX) |> 
  hypothesize(XXXX) |> 
  calculate(XXXX)

# then: simulate your null distribution
null_dist <- XXXX

# next: calculate your p value 
XXXX

# finally: visualize where you sample is with respect to your null distribution
visualize(XXXX) +
  XXXX
```

## d: Interpret your results

With a threshold value of p = .05, do you reject or fail to reject your null hypothesis?
